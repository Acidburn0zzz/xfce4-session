Session manager FAQ:
--------------------

1) Question:
     xfce4-session complains about /tmp/.ICE-unix should be set to root. What
     should I do?

   Answer:
     This is just a security warning. You can either ignore, or change the
     owner of /tmp/.ICE-unix to root. For example, I execute the following
     commands on system startup:

       test -d /tmp/.ICE-unix || mkdir /tmp/.ICE-unix
       chown root /tmp/.ICE-unix
       chmod 1777 /tmp/.ICE-unix


2) Question:
     What do I need to do in order to use xfce4-session as session manager
     with XFce4?

   Answer:
     If you have a recent xfce-utils (post 20030708) then xfce4-session
     is automatically started by startxfce4 as long as you don't have
     a file ~/.xfce4/xinitrc in your home directory. Alternatively you
     can copy the file $sysconfdir/xfce4/xinitrc.xfce4-session to
     ~/.xfce4/xinitrc and start your X session using the startxfce4 script.


3) Question:
     I just downloaded a new splash screen theme. How do I install it?

   Answer:
     Run "xfce-setting-show session" or select "Session management" from
     the settings manager, click the button with the folder icon, select
     the downloaded file and click OK. Then select the new theme from the
     theme selection menu.
