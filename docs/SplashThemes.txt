Splash Screen Themes:
---------------------

You can now specify a splash screen theme to be used by xfce4-session when
logging into your session. A splash screen theme can be either a single
logo image, or a sequence of images.

xfce4-session looks up splash screen themes in
~/.xfce4/splash/$XFSM_SPLASH_THEME/ first, then if not found in
$datadir/xfce4/splash/$XFSM_SPLASH_THEME/. If $XFSM_SPLASH_THEME is not set,
"Default" is taken.

For an example, of how to create a splash screen theme, see the default
one in defaults/splash/.
