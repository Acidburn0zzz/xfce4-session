     TODO:

     * define errors and list what methods can throw which errors
     * be sure the states in both GetState() methods make sense,
       and see if there are others that should be included
     * should we include the SM client ID string in the ClientRegistered
       and/or ClientDisconnected() signals?
     * include a "ShutdownStarted" signal?
     * extra shutdown type for "safe suspend" aka "s2both"?

                    extra time to save their state to do so.

             Implementation note: types 2 through 5 may be implemented
             by simply passing the message along to a power management
             daemon after taking any SM-specific actions needed.
