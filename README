Session manager for the Xfce desktop environment.

How to start the session manager:
---------------------------------
See the sample xinitrc file in $sysconfdir/xfce4/xinitrc.xfce4-session.


Shutting down your computer using the session manager:
------------------------------------------------------
Since 4.1.5, the session manager supports only sudo(8)-based shutdown, other
method can be added by packagers if desired, just replace XfsmShutdownHelper
with your code. To be able to shutdown the computer, you must be listed
in the systems sudoers file, in particular, you must be allowed to execute
$libexecdir/xfsm-shutdown-helper as user root (where $libexecdir is the
libexec subdir in the prefix you installed xfce4-session, for example
/usr/local/libexec).
