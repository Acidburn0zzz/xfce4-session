Session manager for the XFce desktop environment.

Using xfce4-shutdown:
---------------------
In order to use xfce4-shutdown with xfce4-session to reboot/halt the computer,
you have two options:

	a) make $sbindir/xfce4-shutdown setuid to root and add the users
	   that you want to allow to reboot/halt to the file 
	   $sysconfdir/xfce4/shutdown.allow

	b) install sudo(8) and allow the users to execute /sbin/poweroff,
	   /sbin/halt and/or /sbin/reboot.

How to start the session manager:
---------------------------------
See the sample xinitrc file in $sysconfdir/xfce4/xinitrc.xfce4-session.
