* xfce4-session does no longer work with smproxy. We have to write our own
  multihead-safe smproxy replacement.
* Make the logout dialog icon themable through GtkIconTheme


How to support several sessions:
--------------------------------

 * On startup, display "Press F2 for session chooser", the session menu
   contains the saved sessions + Failsafe, if no F2, then start the
   last session. Also support an option "Always display session chooser".
   The session chooser should also offer the ability to remove/rename
   sessions.

 * If Failsafe was started, then display a "Save as" before saving
   the session, so the user can choose a name
