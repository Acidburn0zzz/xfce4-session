 * run SmDiscardCommand when necessary (e.g. pending clients do not fire up,
   or we reach another checkpoint/shutdown)
 * add a SaveYourself timeout, so bogus clients do not prevent the desktop
   from shutdown
 * Multiscreen support is missing (e.g. with the logout screen)
 * Save session on SIGHUP -> SaveYourself checkpoint
 * Save to XML instead of this binary format.
 * Add a systray icon to configure the manager "online". E.g. having a
   menu item "Save session now" to issue a SaveYourself request. (Part. done)
 * Honor SmRestartStyleHint

 * Should we move XfsmTrayIcon to libxfcegui4? It provides a nice way to
   use NetkTrayIcon, and provides the basic functionality all tray icons
   use.

 * Try to translate userids provided by smproxy to usernames if hostnames
   match.

 * Add .spec file

MCS-plugin:
-----------

The following behaviour should be configurable through an MCS plugin:

	* Autosave session every n minutes
