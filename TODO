 * run SmDiscardCommand when necessary (e.g. pending clients do not fire up,
   or we reach another checkpoint/shutdown)
 * add a SaveYourself timeout, so bogus clients do not prevent the desktop
   from shutdown
 * Multiscreen support is missing (e.g. with the logout screen)
 * Save to XML instead of this binary format.
 * Honor SmRestartStyleHint
 * Add APM support (separate SM client)
 * Use GScanner to parse splash.theme files?!
 * Add an option to disable Autostart by xfce4-session
 * Fix "Autostart" with default.session
 * Add configure options to make packagers life easier regarding the
   "shutdown/reboot" thing (see the Mail from Marcel Pol on 20031120)
   [partly done]
 * Add option to disable binding of a TCP/IP socket with ICE (see Moritz
   mail on 20031211).
