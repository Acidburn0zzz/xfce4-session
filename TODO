 * run SmDiscardCommand when necessary (e.g. pending clients do not fire up,
   or we reach another checkpoint/shutdown)
 * add a SaveYourself timeout, so bogus clients do not prevent the desktop
   from shutdown [Initial code exists in manager.c SEE BELOW]
 * Multiscreen support is missing (e.g. with the logout screen)
 * Save to XML instead of this binary format.
 * Honor SmRestartStyleHint
 * Add APM support (separate SM client)
 * Use GScanner to parse splash.theme files?!
 * Add an option to disable Autostart by xfce4-session
 * Fix "Autostart" with default.session [no problem]
 * Add configure options to make packagers life easier regarding the
   "shutdown/reboot" thing (see the Mail from Marcel Pol on 20031120)
   [partly done]
 * Add option to disable binding of a TCP/IP socket with ICE (see Moritz
   mail on 20031211). [done]
 * Remember last selected "Logout action" and make that the default for 
   the next session.
 * Fix the problem with xfce4-session not working on Solaris 9!
 * Use full display string as session identifier instead of hostname only.
 * Move "setenv()" from manager.c to libxfce4util as xfce_setenv()


Solution for the TIMEOUT in SAVEYOURSELF problem:
-------------------------------------------------

 * Handle the interacting clients first
 * Then wait some period of time (e.g. 5-10 seconds) and if some clients
   having finished the SAVE YOURSELF phase during that time, display a
   window with a the list of "sucking" clients and a button "Terminate".
   Pressing terminate will terminate the session regardless of the state
   of the given clients. In addition to the window there should be a timer
   that counts from 60 to 0 seconds and once 0 is reached the session is
   automatically terminated.
