 * run SmDiscardCommand when necessary (e.g. pending clients do not fire up,
   or we reach another checkpoint/shutdown)
 * add a SaveYourself timeout, so bogus clients do not prevent the desktop
   from shutdown
 * Multiscreen support is missing (e.g. with the logout screen)
 * Save to XML instead of this binary format.
 * Honor SmRestartStyleHint

 * Should we move XfsmTrayIcon to libxfcegui4? It provides a nice way to
   use NetkTrayIcon, and provides the basic functionality all tray icons
   use.

 * Try to translate userids provided by smproxy to usernames if hostnames
   match.

 * Add tooltip to the trayicon "x clients connected"

 * Add APM support
