20030710:
---------
	* Added spec file
	* Two Solaris fixes
	* State is now displayed in "session control"
	* added "Quit session" and "Save session" to the tray menu
	  (GtkImageMenuItem's now working btw.)
	* Fixed bug in SaveYourselfDone code (manager does not entered
	  IDLE state after a succesfull checkpoint)
	* Added UNIX signals support: SIGUSR1 saves current session, SIGINT
	  quits current session
	* Added security check to xfce4-shutdown (shutdown.allow has to
	  owned by root to be used)

20030708:
---------
	* startxfce4 in xfce-utils was altered to automatically use
	  xfce4-session by default if installed.
	* Added "session control" dialog and tray icon. Made several
	  improvements. Now requires libxfcegui4 >= 3.92.2
	* smproxy now works with xfce4-session, that says, X11R5 session
	  apps are now managed by the session manager as well (e.g. xcalc,
	  xedit, xbiff or even apps like gimp and gqview)

20030707:
---------
	* Splash screen themes can now be selected from the settings plugin,
	  and in addition, you can also install new themes from the settings
	  plugin.
	* Added docs/FAQ file.

20030706:
---------
	* the session manager now takes care of starting files in
	  ~/Desktop/Autostart/ after all session aware apps are restarted.
	  This should make live easier, esp. with apps that depend on
	  the window manager already running.
	* the splash screen is now themable. See docs/SplashThemes.txt for
	  further information. In addition, the splash screen also appears
	  when starting a default session, and not only when restoring a
	  previously saved session.

20030702:
---------
	* session file naming scheme has changed from
		~/.xfce4/sessions/session-<hostname>
	  to
		~/.xfce4/sessions/xfsm-<hostname>
