	* Splash screen themes can now be selected from the settings plugin,
	  and in addition, you can also install new themes from the settings
	  plugin.
	* Added docs/FAQ file.

---------
	* the session manager now takes care of starting files in
	  ~/Desktop/Autostart/ after all session aware apps are restarted.
	  This should make live easier, esp. with apps that depend on
	  the window manager already running.
	* the splash screen is now themable. See docs/SplashThemes.txt for
	  further information. In addition, the splash screen also appears
	  when starting a default session, and not only when restoring a
	  previously saved session.

20030702:
---------
	* session file naming scheme has changed from
		~/.xfce4/sessions/session-<hostname>
	  to
		~/.xfce4/sessions/xfsm-<hostname>
